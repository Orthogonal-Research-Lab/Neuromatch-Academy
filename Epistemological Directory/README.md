# How to use this Repo
Welcome! Please free to update and build out Epistemlogical Directories as you see fit.

How to do that?
- Contribute Resources
- Add a topic (either a general topical folder, or a sub-item within such folder)
- Submit a coding example (or start your own personal folder in the main directory)
- Create a jupyter notebook walking through an application
- Embed questions or comments in existing Directories or works - that others can answer!

Consider this repo someplace between a wiki, database, and general collection of resources. 

Good luck with prep & study for Neuromatch Academy!
