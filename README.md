## Welcome to OREL's Neuromatch Academy Study Grounp Materials & Epistemological Directories!
Neuromatch Academy (NMA), July 13-31 (2020)  

This is a place to explore topics and ideas surrounding the NMA course prep and content. 
- In [Epistemological Directories (ED)](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/tree/master/Epistemological%20Directory), you will find a series of topical stubs, which you can contribute to with infographics, reference lists, notes and points to revisit, or even slideshows! 
- In [Student Folders](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/tree/master/Students), feel free to include an intro and any personal work associated with your NMA prep or ideas that may not fit into the shared Epistemic Directories section. 


Contributions can be made via [issues](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/issues), pull requests, additions to the [Project Board](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/projects/1), or submitted via [e-mail](mailto:Orthogonal-Lab@outlook.com). 

You can also annotate this README using [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) (using their Chrome plug-in or bookmarklet). 

For text-based pull requests, you should create .md files written in Markdown ([see tutorial here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXlZ2tEndNPOO1vmL4_MoAt-Tqjd0dUU/view?usp=sharing) for a quick tutorial).

Join our [discussion group](https://representational-brains-phenotypes.weebly.com/neuromatch-academy.html)! We will also be collaborating in groups using this repository, [OREL Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T48BNG3A5/C015B5V5TEH), and [OREL Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/orthogonal_lab).

Don't forget to go through the preparatory materials! While the curriculum does not require a high degree of knowledge in Neuroscience or Computational thinking, you should brush up on the basics.
